I wanted to show how wind turbine works with HomeIO, how can I control it, so I've recorded a simple demo.

<div class="vimeo"><iframe src='http://player.vimeo.com/video/135051782' width="600" height="400" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen> </iframe></div>

I've used [kazam](https://launchpad.net/kazam) and [kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/) while recording.
